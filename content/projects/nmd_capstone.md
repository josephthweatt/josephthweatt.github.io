_Designed an inventory system for the humanitarian organization No More Deaths._

No More Deaths ([NMD]) is an organization dedicated to providing humanitarian aid to
people in the Sonoran Desert. People traversing the desert are susceptible to
dehydration, exhaustion and malnourishment. The organizations chief goal is to
limit the number of deaths by supplying food and water to certain areas within
the desert. Due to its proximity to the Mexico-Arizona border, the Sonoran
Desert sees plenty of foot traffic from migrants crossing into the United
States. While this has cast criticism on the organization at times, it does not
negate the pure intentions of the organizations members and their dedication to
protecting human life.

With this organization, me and my team of five other Computer Science students
designed and implemented an inventory tracking system for NMD. This involved a
mobile app which displayed supply locations and areas of interest on a map,
allowing users to make record of visits to these locations, record the amount
of supplies dropped off, and update the canonical inventory list with an
admin's permission.

I personally oversaw the creation of the mobile application, as well as
contributing to the design of the API endpoints that it was expected to call.
Due to the nature of the project, I cannot share my code, but I can say that
my team was successful in creating a proof of concept for the system, including 
a functional server and application.
