_Created an application to determine an ideal Solar Panel setup based on
a user's need and location._

[See the Code]

Sophomore year I joined an undergraduate research project to create the
_Optimal Photovoltaic Systems for Residential Areas_, abbreviated OPSRA. This
system took into account user constraints to find, rank, and display the best
configuration of solar components for that user. User constraints included
budget, desired energy output and location (to determine if weather conditions
permit the configuration to harness an acceptable amount of energy).

This project was done under the Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI)
and under direct supervision of [Dr. Rong Pan]. Dr. Pan and the FURI
organizers were a tremendous help in actualizing this project, serving as both
mentors in professional academic research and as a resource for researching and
coding the project. Ultimately, I was given considerable freedom when it came
to choosing my research and how it would be implemented. The code is available
on Github, if you would like to check it out.
