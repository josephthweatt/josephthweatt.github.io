_Created an application to allow users to broadcast their location amongst a shared group._

[See the Code]

Although the 100 and 200-level classes formed the foundation of my
programming knowledge, it was my first personal project in the Summer of
2016 that truly taught me how various devices worked together to form a
coherent application.

This project had a lot of firsts for me. It was the first time I worked with
databases (MySQL), the first time I used a sophisticated API (Google Maps),
the first time I made a dynamic website (PHP), and the first time hosting a
service on a publicly available server. The concepts of all of these were duly
enforced by the fact that I had to combine them all together to efficiently
share user locations among a user created channel.

Of course, I would be lying if I said there weren't a great deal of setbacks.
Being unfamiliar with most of the technology I was using, as well as being the
sole the developer of the application, a lot of the finished product is
unpolished and prone to bugs. In hindsight, this is something that could have
been easily prevented through the use of proper test cases, version control and
a more cohesive architecture (these were things I quickly learned at
[Connexta] and [ViaSat]).
