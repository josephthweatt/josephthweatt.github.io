I am a CS Graduate student at Arizona State University, graduating in May, 2019. I have completed two summer internships, worked as a CS tutor, and co-founded ASU's first mobile development club.

When I'm not working on my Master's or my internship, I can be found helping coordinate events for my club, learning new programming skills, reading, writing, and working on small projects with my friends.
