_Worked on projects important to the Commercial Mobility Department._

The work I did while interning at ViaSat was not only a great learning 
experience, but a critical contribution in my team's latest software relase. 
Without going too far into details, one of the major projects assigned
to me and the other interns involved persisting user account infomation
when switching between networks in-flight. The inclusion of this
feature in the release required the input of several engineers 
throughout our department, but ultimately, the writing and testing of
the feature in code fell to the interns.

This summer also gave me the chance to familiarize myself with AWS. The
second major project of this internship involved using AWS Lambda to
host a shared service. This was done in order to make some parts of
our backend serverless, and to test the overall cost and viability of
such an approach.

I was delighted to have worked with ViaSat's Commercial Mobility team, 
and am grateful for the faith they placed in me and the other interns.
