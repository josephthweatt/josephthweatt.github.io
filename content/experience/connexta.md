_Worked in a team to create features, fixes, and improvements on the Distributed Data Framework._

While at Connexta, I was working with an open source project called the Distributed Data 
Framework ([DDF]). This is a modular integration framework used to share data between various 
sources and organizations. I made a significant number of contributions to the master branch, 
most of which is still in production today.

Connexta was also my first exposure to professional software development and the Agile Process. 
The team here is simply exceptional, with a flat organizational structure and great 
leadership all around.
