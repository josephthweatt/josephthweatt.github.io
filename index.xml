      <description>Worked on projects important to the Commercial Mobility Department.
The work I did while interning at ViaSat was not only a great learning experience, but a critical contribution in my team&amp;rsquo;s latest software relase. Without going too far into details, one of the major projects assigned to me and the other interns involved persisting user account infomation when switching between networks in-flight. The inclusion of this feature in the release required the input of several engineers throughout our department, but ultimately, the writing and testing of the feature in code fell to the interns.</description>

      <title>Capstone Project: No More Deaths</title>

      <description>Designed an inventory system for the humanitarian organization No More Deaths.
No More Deaths (NMD) is an organization dedicated to providing humanitarian aid to people in the Sonoran Desert. People traversing the desert are susceptible to dehydration, exhaustion and malnourishment. The organizations chief goal is to limit the number of deaths by supplying food and water to certain areas within the desert. Due to its proximity to the Mexico-Arizona border, the Sonoran Desert sees plenty of foot traffic from migrants crossing into the United States.</description>

      <description>Worked in a team to create features, fixes, and improvements on the Distributed Data Framework.
While at Connexta, I was working with an open source project called the Distributed Data Framework (DDF). This is a modular integration framework used to share data between various sources and organizations. I made a significant number of contributions to the master branch, most of which is still in production today.
Connexta was also my first exposure to professional software development and the Agile Process.</description>

      <description>Assisted undergraduate students in understanding core computer science concepts.
Helped students better understand the coursework for 100-300 level classes. Key concepts I helped mentor included fundamental programming skills, OOP, pointers, assembly, and developer tools such as the debugger and git.</description>

      <description>Created an application to allow users to broadcast their location amongst a shared group.
See the Code
Although the 100 and 200-level classes formed the foundation of my programming knowledge, it was my first personal project in the Summer of 2016 that truly taught me how various devices worked together to form a coherent application.
This project had a lot of firsts for me. It was the first time I worked with databases (MySQL), the first time I used a sophisticated API (Google Maps), the first time I made a dynamic website (PHP), and the first time hosting a service on a publicly available server.</description>

      <description>Created an application to determine an ideal Solar Panel setup based on a user&amp;rsquo;s need and location.
See the Code
Sophomore year I joined an undergraduate research project to create the Optimal Photovoltaic Systems for Residential Areas, abbreviated OPSRA. This system took into account user constraints to find, rank, and display the best configuration of solar components for that user. User constraints included budget, desired energy output and location (to determine if weather conditions permit the configuration to harness an acceptable amount of energy).</description>
