      <description>Designed an inventory system for the humanitarian organization No More Deaths.
No More Deaths (NMD) is an organization dedicated to providing humanitarian aid to people in the Sonoran Desert. People traversing the desert are susceptible to dehydration, exhaustion and malnourishment. The organizations chief goal is to limit the number of deaths by supplying food and water to certain areas within the desert. Due to its proximity to the Mexico-Arizona border, the Sonoran Desert sees plenty of foot traffic from migrants crossing into the United States.</description>

      <description>Created an application to allow users to broadcast their location amongst a shared group.
See the Code
Although the 100 and 200-level classes formed the foundation of my programming knowledge, it was my first personal project in the Summer of 2016 that truly taught me how various devices worked together to form a coherent application.
This project had a lot of firsts for me. It was the first time I worked with databases (MySQL), the first time I used a sophisticated API (Google Maps), the first time I made a dynamic website (PHP), and the first time hosting a service on a publicly available server.</description>

      <description>Created an application to determine an ideal Solar Panel setup based on a user&amp;rsquo;s need and location.
See the Code
Sophomore year I joined an undergraduate research project to create the Optimal Photovoltaic Systems for Residential Areas, abbreviated OPSRA. This system took into account user constraints to find, rank, and display the best configuration of solar components for that user. User constraints included budget, desired energy output and location (to determine if weather conditions permit the configuration to harness an acceptable amount of energy).</description>
